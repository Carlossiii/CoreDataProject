Literary theorists, for example, focus primarily on literary textsâ€”novels, essays, stories, and poems. Legal scholars focus on legal texts such as laws, contracts, decrees, and regulations. Cultural theorists work with a wide variety of texts, including those that may not typically be the subject of studies, such as advertisements, signage, instruction manuals, and other ephemera.", registered: Date.now, tags: ["student", "gettingcrazy", "gettingmarried:D"], friends: [])
